   <a href="nazarene.org"><img src="../../Images/NazareneSeal.png" style="width: 15%;"/></a><strong style="font-size: 20px;"> The Church of the Nazarene</strong><br> is a Protestant Christian 
    church in the Wesleyan-Holiness tradition, tracing its roots to an anniversary date of 1908. It was founded to spread the message of scriptural 
    holiness (Christlike living) across the lands.<br><br>Today the Church of the Nazarene is located in 159 world areas and is a Great Commission church. 
    Our mission is to make Christlike disciples in the nations. We believe that God offers to everyone forgiveness, peace, joy, purpose, love, meaning in 
    life, and the promise of heaven when life is over by entering and experiencing a personal relationship with God through Jesus Christ. We are called to 
    take this message to people everywhere.<br><br>
The Church of the Nazarene is also a holiness church. We believe that Christians can experience a deeper level of life in which there is victory over sin, power to witness and serve, and a richer fellowship with God, all through the infilling of the Holy Spirit.
